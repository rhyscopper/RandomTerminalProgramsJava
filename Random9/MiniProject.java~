The Following Program Of Which I Have Created Is For My Mini-Project Part Of My Coursework.  
In The Following Program I Have Got It To Output A Music Related Message Which Is "What is the better known stage name of Robyn Fenty?!"
The User Will Then Be Able To enter A Message.
After This The User Is Given A Random Score And Then A Message Is Printed Out Which Says: "User Answer", That's An Intriguing Answer! Score Awarded: "Random Number Received."
User Answer is what is imputed by the user and Random Number Received is the random number given to the user.
once this has been printed out to the screen the program is finished.
